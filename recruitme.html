            Colin is a classically-trained computer scientist with a penchant
            for journalism. I write code and articles. Colin aspires to be a
            polymath,
            as his thirst for knowledge knows few topical bounds. He once upon a
            time aspired to teach high school computer science.

            He would eventually like to find himself in the employ of himself or
            someone with similar goals and talents, doing whatever he loves and
            loving whatever he is doing. Starting a company with a web app as its
            primary product sounds like a great plan, but he keeps an open mind.

                makes its way into his inbox. Please don't be offended if he doesn't

                Please do not bother to contact Colin with employment offers
                that <em>require</em> relocation, unless you absolutely must
                have him, and
                only he is suitable for the position you wish to fill, and

          <h2>On Interviewing Colin</h2>
          <p class="blurb">
            If steps in your interview process not involving human interaction, 
            e.g. a code test, take more than two hours, please devise an abbreviated test prior to contacting Colin. 
            Then, use that test on him and everyone else you interview after him, because no code test should ever
            take more than two non-contiguous hours.
          </p>
          <p class="blurb">
            If contrived evaluations like whiteboarding, digital or in-person, would be a part of the interview, 
            please skip these parts of the interview for Colin. He has found that these evaluations do not reflect
            accurately the skills of the candidates whom he has evaluated over the years. He long since eliminated
            whiteboarding from his interview processes because of its ineffectiveness and would not wish that method
            upon anyone, interviewee or interviewer.
          </p>
          <p class="blurb">
            Colin generally doesn't have the bandwidth to study for a technical examination even if directly related to the role
            I’m pursuing because of his community leadership activities. He’d be happy to interview in a process
            that is well-defined but more oriented toward the life of an engaged professional with obligations outside
            of the workplace, such as children, a time-consuming hobby, or long-term volunteering.
