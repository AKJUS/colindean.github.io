            These are some of the <em>publicly-available</em> projects of which I am most proud.
            Some are still under active development and for some of which my role has ended.
            Some are things that may return one day to active development.
            Projects listed here are ones in which I have or had a major role.
          </p>

          <ul class="projects">
            <li>
              Maintainer,
              <a href="https://github.com/target/data-validator">Data Validator by Target</a>,
              2019&ndash;.
              I took over maintainership of this open source data validation tool for Apache Spark
              shortly after its initial public release.
            </li>
            <li>
              Author and engineer,
              <a href="https://codeandsupply.co/survey">Code &amp; Supply Compensation Survey &amp; Report</a>,
              2017&ndash;.
              I created, researched, directed, conducted, built, analyzed, coded, promoted, sought sponsors for, and
              wrote the majority of the content for this survey of salaries, bonuses, work-life balance, job satisfaction,
              and other things tech workers think about w.r.t. their careers and lives.
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintainer,
              <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle/">Homebrew Bundle</a>,
              2018&ndash;2021.
              I effected upgrades and added functionality to this widely-used dependency manifest component
              of the <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew package manager</a>.
            </li>
            <li>

              >Building 360&deg; Information Applications</a>.
              This IBM Redbooks&reg; publication provides information about
              Watson Explorer 9.0, InfoSphere MDM, and PME for InfoSphere BigInsights&trade;.
              It gives an overview, describes the architecture, and presents use
              cases that usable to understand the core capabilities of Watson Explorer,
              InfoSphere MDM, and PME for BigInsights, realize the full potential
              of Watson Explorer applications, describe the integration and
              value of the combination of Watson Explorer and InfoSphere MDM,
              build a 360-degree information application, and learn by example
              by following hands-on lab scenarios.

          </ul>

          <p>There are lots more projects that I can talk about, but have no public link or public documentation
          of my involvement. Why not ask me about them over a beer?</p>

          <p>I keep most of my code on <a href="https://github.com/colindean?tab=repositories">my Github</a>.
          See the "Sources" tab there for projects I've started, or the "Forks" tab for projects to which I have
          contributed at some point. There are always projects to which I've contributed that I have removed from
          my forks list, though, so perhaps give a good search for "colindean" in Github's primary search!</p>
